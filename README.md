# **Phase-field**
<br>

## What is it?

This project is aiming to simulate the mechanism of magnetostriction by LLG equation using phase-field method.

<br>

## How to use?
Before installing the code you need to get **gcc** to compile and **openCV4** to make the png images.<br>

We recommend to use **pkg-config** to link around opencv packages to compile. Please check your link before.

We newly import **fftw3** for calculate dft more fast. please install by terminal before compiling.<br>
To install fftw3 in Ubuntu, type<br>
>`$ sudo apt install libfftw3-3 libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc`<br>

Importing **Eigen** for calculate the elastic stiffness tensor. please install by terminal before compiling.<br>
To install fftw3 in Ubuntu, type<br>
>`$ sudo apt install libeigen3-dev`<br>
1. Make the directory for clone repository.<br>

>`$ mkdir new_folder_name`<br>
>`$ cd new_folder_name`<br>

2. Clone the repository.<br>

>`$ git clone git@github.com/ngtrr/phase-field.git`<br>

3. Compile and excute it.<br>

>$ g++ -o output magne.cpp `pkg-config --cflags opencv4` `pkg-config --libs opencv4`<br>
>`$ ./output`<br>

## The directory

- [x] **ichigo.cpp**   -   main script for fsma simulation. it collaborate micromagnetics simulation using LLG-equation and phase-field simulation to simulate the martensite transition using time-depend GL-equation(TDGL-equation).<br>
- [ ] **pineapple.cpp**   -   it work same as ichigo.cpp. but the phase-field simulation which is used for martensite transition has the filed-valiable as a strain! eventually I failed to make this ... (the simulation works but it diverge).<br>
- [ ] **mikan.cpp**   -   it work same as ichigo.cpp too. the script of martensite transition is diverted fromã€€martensite.cpp. it doesn't work ideally so maybe some kind of parts (mostly the stray field component?) has to be fixed before using.<br>
- [x] **magne.cpp**   -   script of micromagnetics with component of magnetoelasticity.<br>
- [x] **fftwcheck.cpp**   -   Just checking the behavior of fftw3. unnecessary.<br>
- [x] **martensite.cpp**  -   phase-field simulation about martensite transition using openCV.<br>
- [x] **command.txt**   -   how to compile the code.<br>
- [x] **a.jpg b.jpg c.jpg**   -   images for the initial of simulation.<br>
- [ ] **the_logic.md**   -   describes the logic of this program.<br>
